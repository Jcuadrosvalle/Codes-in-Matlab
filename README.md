# Codes in Matlab
---
In this repository you will find four codes in Matlab.
--
Code 1: Determines if the weights determine a singularity of type BP, Chain or Cycle.
--
Code 2: Determines if the weights determine a singularity of type  BP+Chain, BP+Cycle, Chain+Chain, Chain+Cycle, Cycle+Cycle.
--
Code 3: Determines if the weights determine a singularity of type BP+Chain+Cycle, BP+Chain+Chain, BP+Cycle+Cycle.
--
Code 4: Computes the degree, Milnor numbber and third homology group of the link applying Orlik algorithm.
