# Codes in Matlab

In this repository you will find 6 codes in Matlab: 
--
I) the first four were written for the paper Sasaki-Einstein 7-manifolds and Orlik's conjecture.
--
II) the last two codes where written for the paper Berglund-HÃ¼bsch transpose and Einstein metrics on rational homology 7-spheres.
--
--
Code1: Determines if the weights determine a singularity of type BP, Chain or Cycle.
--
Code2: Determines if the weights determine a singularity of type  BP+Chain, BP+Cycle, Chain+Chain, Chain+Cycle, Cycle+Cycle.
--
Code3: Determines if the weights determine a singularity of type BP+Chain+Cycle, BP+Chain+Chain, BP+Cycle+Cycle.
--
Code4: Computes the degree, Milnor number and third homology group of the link of a hypersurface singularity of index equal to 1.
